<h2>
<a name = "INTRO">
Introduction and Description
</a>
</h2>

<p>

gleem is a small, self-contained library of 3D widgets that support
direct user interaction with a 3D scene. Both Java and C++ programming
language implementations are included and have similar APIs. The user
interfaces are roughly based on the manipulators in <a href =
"http://www.sgi.com/">Silicon Graphics'</a> <a href =
"http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/">Open Inventor</a>; the names
are borrowed from Inventor.

</p>
<p>

The currently implemented manipulators are:

<ul>
<li> Translate1Manip: translation along a line
<li> Translate2Manip: translation in a plane
<li> HandleBoxManip: 3D translation and rotation
</ul>

</p>
<p>

The most recent version of gleem is available from <a href =
"http://www.media.mit.edu/~kbrussel/gleem/">http://www.media.mit.edu/~kbrussel/gleem/</a>.

</p>
<p>

gleem uses <a href = "http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for rendering
of its manipulators. The Java programming language version of gleem is
built on top of Jausoft's <a href =
"http://www.jausoft.com/gl4java/">OpenGL for Java</a> and uses the
Java platform's window system support to collect mouse events; the C++
version uses <a href =
"http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut.html">GLUT</a>
for window system interaction. All of the data structures for storing
shapes and computing mouse pointer-object intersections are done
within the library, not using the OpenGL picking mechanisms.

<p>

gleem currently does not implement Inventor-style fields, field-to-field
connections, reference counting, run-time type checking, instantiation by
type ID, or any other of the basic mechanisms which made Inventor possible.
It is implemented entirely using virtual functions; there is no casting
down the hierarchy based on run-time type checks.

</p>
<p>

The most fundamental limitation of gleem is that, in the interest of
portability, it has no notion of a scene graph. It defines what little such
support it needs internally. All manipulators live conceptually in world
coordinates. If you want to attach a manipulator to the end of a kinematic
chain, for example, you will need to manually keep the manipulator in place
as your application moves the links.

<h2>
<a name = "HOWTO-JAVA">
How to Incorporate gleem Into Java Programs
</a>
</h2>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-JAVA-COMPILE">
Compiling gleem for Java
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The Java programming language version of gleem was developed with <a
href = "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">JDK 1.4</a> and <a href =
"http://www.jausoft.com/gl4java/">OpenGL for Java 2.8</a>. The sources
make use of the new <code>assert</code> keyword and therefore will not
compile with earlier JDKs.

</p>
<p>

Rather than dropping the OpenGL for Java jar and DLL/DSO into the JDK,
it is recommended to set up CLASSPATH and either PATH or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH entries to point at an installation elsewhere on the
local disk. This should avoid conflicts when launching applications
with <a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java Web
Start</a> that attempt to download a particular version of OpenGL for
Java.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-JAVA-MANIPS">
Incorporating Manips into a Java Program
</a>
</h3>

<p>

To use gleem's manipulators in a Java program:

<ol>
<li> Use the <code>GLEventListener</code> programming model in OpenGL
     for Java rather than subclassing <code>GLCanvas</code> or any of
     the other widget classes. gleem's ExaminerViewer, in particular,
     relies on being able to add a <code>GLEventListener</code> to the
     <code>GLDrawable</code> to which it is attached.
<li> Register each <code>GLDrawable</code> with the ManipManager by
     calling <code>ManipManager.registerWindow()</code> from within
     your GLEventListener's <code>init</code> method.
<li> If you choose not to allow the ManipManager to install
     MouseListeners and MouseMotionListeners for a given window
     (usually because you need to consume some of these events in your
     application without their being processed by gleem; see the
     ExaminerViewer for an example), call
     <code>ManipManager.removeMouseListeners()</code> and then send
     mouse motion, drag, and button events to gleem using
     <code>ManipManager</code>'s <code>mouseMoved</code>,
     <code>mouseDragged</code>, <code>mousePressed</code>, and
     <code>mouseReleased</code> methods.
<li> Register each manipulator in the windows you want it to be
     visible by calling <code>ManipManager.showManipInWindow()</code>.
<li> Add a call to <code>ManipManager.updateCameraParameters()</code>
     to your <code>GLEventListener</code>'s <code>display</code>
     method with parameters of your viewing frustum (forward and up
     vectors, vertical FOV, image plane aspect ratio, horizontal and
     vertical size of window). gleem currently only handles frusta
     corresponding to symmetric truncated pyramids.
<li> Add a call to <code>ManipManager.render()</code> to your
     <code>display</code> method.

</ol>

</p>
<p>

Note that gleem's Java programming language APIs are more strict than
the C++ versions about explicitly registering and unregistering
windows. The Java platform's window system interface is inherently
multithreaded and the added strictness should help ensure the
correctness of applications using the library.

</p>
<p>

You can then call methods such as <code>getTranslation()</code> and
<code>getRotation()</code> on the above manipulator classes in, for
example, your <code>display</code> method, and feed those values
elsewhere. You can also register a motion listener via
<code>Manip.addMotionListener()</code> which will be called each time
the manipulator is moved.

</p>
<p>

See the sources TestTranslate1.java, TestTranslate2.java, and
TestHandleBox.java for specific, small examples of instantiating
manipulators.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-JAVA-EXAMINER">
Incorporating the Examiner Viewer
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The ExaminerViewer class implements trackball-style rotation,
translation, and dollying of the scene. Its controls are similar to
those of Open Inventor's Examiner Viewer; see the <a
href="#UI-EXAMINER">user interface</a> section below for details.

</p>
<p>

To use the ExaminerViewer in conjunction with the ManipManager:

</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li> Register the <code>GLDrawable</code> with the ManipManager. This
     should generally be done within the <code>init</code> method of
     your <code>GLEventListener</code>.
<li> Instantiate an ExaminerViewer. The MouseButtonHelper class can be
     used to determine how many mouse buttons are present.
<li> Attach the ExaminerViewer to the drawable. Note that this must be
     done after the drawable has been registered with the ManipManager.
     At this stage a BSphereProvider, used during viewAll() operations,
     must be specified.
<li> (Recommended) Call the <code>viewAll</code> method on the viewer
     to set it up for initial interaction.
</ol>

</p>
<p>

See TestExaminerViewer.java for an example which creates a HandleBoxManip
inside of an ExaminerViewer.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-JAVA-MULTIWIN">
Multiple Window and Multi-Threading Support
</a>
</h3>

<p>

As the Java platform's window system is inherently multithreaded, the
Java version of gleem is necessarily mostly thread-safe. The
ManipManager class is thread-safe, but individual manipulator
instances are not. Multiple window support is handled through the
ManipManager's <code>registerWindow</code>,
<code>unregisterWindow</code>, <code>showManipInWindow</code>, and
<code>removeManipFromWindow</code> methods.

How to Incorporate gleem Into C++ Programs
</a>
</h2>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-C++-COMPILE">
Compiling gleem for C++
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The C++ version of gleem was originally developed under SGI's Irix 6.5
and later ported to Windows. The Unix Makefile is currently set up for
SGI's CC and include directories. Type "make" in the gleem
subdirectory to build the library and tests. You will need to set your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to, for example,
/users/yourname/gleem-1.2/c++-impl/lib/iris before running any of the
tests.

</p>
<p>

Project files for Microsoft's Visual C++ are located in the
subdirectory c++-impl/gleem/visualc .

</p>
<p>

The sources should be quite portable and compilable with any recent
C++ compiler. STL support is required and SGI's version of the STL is
included in the distribution. By default gleem puts all of its
datatypes into the namespace "gleem", but if your compiler doesn't
support namespaces you can define the preprocessor variable
GLEEM_NO_NAMESPACES (Namespace.h). If you port gleem to another
platform, please consider making a cross-platform Makefile for gmake
and submitting your work. The "machtype" script in the top-level
directory may be useful for this purpose.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-C++-MANIPS">
Incorporating Manips into a C++ Program
</a>
</h3>

<p>

To use gleem's manipulators in a C++ program using OpenGL and GLUT:

<ol>
<li> Add a call to <code>ManipManager::init()</code> to your
     <code>main()</code>.  There must be an open window at this point
     if you want the ManipManager to install its callbacks. (To
     disable callback installation, call
     <code>ManipManager::init(false)</code>.)
<li> If you choose not to allow the ManipManager to install mouse
     motion, passive motion, and mouse button callbacks (usually
     because you need to consume certain kinds of events in your
     application without their being processed by gleem; see the
     ExaminerViewer and TestExaminerViewer for an example), you need
     to call ManipManager's <code>mouseFunc</code>,
     <code>motionFunc</code>, and <code>passiveMotionFunc</code>
     methods at the end of your callbacks for events that should be
     processed by gleem.
<li> Make regular calls to
     <code>ManipManager::updateCameraParameters()</code> with
     parameters of your viewing frustum (forward and up vectors,
     vertical FOV, image plane aspect ratio, horizontal and vertical
     size of window). gleem currently only handles frusta
     corresponding to symmetric truncated pyramids.
<li> Add a call to <code>ManipManager::render()</code> to your display
     callback.
</ol>

</p>
<p>

You can then call methods such as <code>getTranslation()</code> and
<code>getRotation()</code> on the above manipulator classes in, for
example, your GLUT render callback, and feed those values elsewhere.
You can also register a motion callback via
<code>Manip::addMotionCallback()</code> which will be called each time
the manipulator is moved.

</p>
<p>

See the sources TestTranslate1.cpp, TestTranslate2.cpp, and
TestHandleBox.cpp for specific, small examples of instantiating
manipulators.

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-C++-EXAMINER">
Incorporating the Examiner Viewer
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The ExaminerViewer class implements trackball-style rotation,
translation, and dollying of the scene. Its controls are similar to
those of Open Inventor's Examiner Viewer; see the <a
href="#UI-EXAMINER">user interface</a> section below for details.

</p>
<p>

To use the ExaminerViewer in conjunction with the ManipManager:

</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li> Instantiate an Examiner Viewer (i.e., <code>ExaminerViewer *viewer =
new ExaminerViewer();</code>). This creates a new window internally and
overrides mouse and motion callbacks.
<li> Call <code>ManipManager::init(false);</code>. It isn't possible to
re-install the ExaminerViewer's callbacks if they're overridden, so it's
important not to let the ManipManager do so.
<li> Set up the ManipManager as a mouse and motion delegate for the
ExaminerViewer.
<pre>
  viewer->setMouseDelegate(ManipManager::mouseFunc);
  viewer->setMotionDelegate(ManipManager::motionFunc);
</pre>
<li> To get highlighting of manips to work, set up the ManipManager's
passive motion callback manually.
<pre>
  viewer->makeCurrent();
  glutPassiveMotionFunc(ManipManager::passiveMotionFunc);
</pre>
<li> (Recommended) Give the ExaminerViewer a BSphereProvider so it can
compute the bounding sphere of the scene, and call viewAll() before the
first render. See TestExaminerViewer.cpp for an example of how you might
compute a bounding sphere for a manipulator.
<li> Add a call to <code>viewer->update();</code> before you begin drawing
your geometry. This recomputes the ModelView and Projection matrices for
the current rendering context. You should then be able to push matrices on
top of the one loaded by the ExaminerViewer to effect a camera moving about
the scene.
</ol>

</p>
<p>

See TestExaminerViewer.cpp for an example which creates a HandleBoxManip
inside of an ExaminerViewer.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "HOWTO-MULTIWIN">
Multiple Window and Multi-Threading Support (or Lack of)
</a>
</h3>

<p>

gleem supports rendering manipulators in multiple windows. See
<code>ManipManager::windowCreated()</code>,
<code>ManipManager::windowDestroyed()</code>,
<code>ManipManager::addManipToWindow()</code>, and
<code>ManipManager::removeManipFromWindow</code>. By default, manipulators
are rendered in the window which was current at the time of their
instantiation (determined via <code>glutGetWindow()</code>.) See
<code>TestMultiWin.cpp</code> for an example of rendering the same
manipulator into two windows.

</p>
<p>

<b>The C++ version of gleem is not thread-safe</b>. You should not
attempt to instantiate or use gleem objects in more than one
thread. Further, gleem assumes it is valid to make OpenGL calls, so
the library will probably not work properly in a multiprocessing
environment like SGI's Performer without modification.

<h2>

</h2>

<h3>
<a name = "UI-TRANSLATE12">
Translate1Manip and Translate2Manip User Interface
</a>
</h3>

<p>

Click and drag to cause motion along a line or in a plane.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "UI-HANDLEBOX">
HandleBoxManip User Interface
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The HandleBoxManipulator contains a box with six faces. Clicking and
dragging on any of these six faces causes translational motion in the plane
parallel to the face.

</p>
<p>

Each of the six rotation handles, which lie above the cube's faces, can be
used to rotate the manipulator about two possible axes. At the start of a
drag motion, one of the two rotation axes is chosen: the one most parallel
to the viewing direction. If you visualize the two perpendicular planes
which go through the handle, the center of the cube, and the three other
rotation handles, the plane in which rotation occurs is the one which is
facing the camera the most when the drag is initiated.

</p>
<p>

Scaling is performed with the eight corner handles. Clicking and dragging
these handles causes aspect ratio-preserving scaling about the origin of
the cube. Shift-clicking and dragging allows stretching of the cube about
one of two axes. The two possible axes are chosen when the handle is first
shift-clicked, and are chosen to be the principal axes of the face adjacent
to the handle which most faces the camera. Scaling along either of these
two axes may be the result of the drag; which of the two is chosen is
determined using a "snap-to" paradigm, and can change during the drag.

</p>

<h3>
<a name = "UI-EXAMINER">
ExaminerViewer User Interface
</a>
</h3>

<p>

The ExaminerViewer behaves similarly to Inventor's Examiner Viewer. It
grabs all drag motions when the Alt key is depressed. The ExaminerViewer
has a conceptual "focal point" which is always defined as being the focal
distance directly in front of the camera.

</p>
<p>

Drag motions with Alt key depressed:
<ul>
<li> Button 1: Rotate about focal point
<li> Button 2: Translate in plane parallel to image plane. Note that this
causes subsequent rotations to be performed about a point which is likely
not to be the precise center of the scene.
<li> Buttons 1+2: Dolly in/out in direction perpendicular to image plane.
This motion increases or decreases the focal distance depending on the
dollying direction.
</ul>

</p>
<p>

Calling the viewAll() method re-positions (but does not re-orient) the
ExaminerViewer so the bounding sphere given by the BSphereProvider is
contained entirely within the viewing frustum. The focal distance is reset
to be the distance between the camera and the center of the bounding
sphere.

Library Overview
</a>
</h3>

<p>

Manipulators contain Manipulator Parts. The ManipPart hierarchy is
divided into two sections, one containing triangle-based pieces of
manipulators and one which contains grouping nodes (analogues to Group
and Transform nodes). This is gleem's scene graph mechanism. A
warning: in the C++ version, shared instancing of "nodes" (ManipParts)
in this scene graph is not allowed (since reference counting is not
implemented). The ManipManager keeps track of all instantiated
manipulators and handles the picking mechanism as well as rendering.

</p>
<p>

The Manip base class only implements a minimal interface; it is
intended that you refer to manipulators through a pointer to the
concrete type rather than the abstract Manip type. The simple
manipulators (Translate1Manip, Translate2Manip) contain
replaceGeometry() methods so you can customize the draggers with
whatever geometry you like. It is not so simple to customize a more
complex manipulator like the HandleBoxManip, so it contains no such
method.

</p>
<p>

Each manipulator understands its constraints and implements its drag()
method from scratch. Clearly there is some commonality between the
Translate2Dragger and the translation functionality of the HandleBoxManip.
However, this commonality has not been abstracted into a set of classes
like Inventor's projectors. Instead there are a few geometrical classes
(Line, Plane, PlaneUV) which encapsulate such functionality as ray casting
and point projection, and the manipulators determine how to use this
information based on what manipulator part was selected and the current
configuration of the manipulator.

</p>
<p>

The linear algebra gleem uses is quite simple and should be accessible to
anyone with anyone who has taken an undergraduate linear algebra course.  I
encourage you to experiment with more sophisticated algorithms for the drag
mechanisms.

<h2>
<a name = "FAQ">
Frequently Asked Questions
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Q: Why don't the manipulators show up in the right place in my application?
(Or, why can't I drag them?)
</p>

<p>

A: gleem expects the following from the rendering state at the time
you call ManipManager's <code>render</code> method:

<ul>
<li> Lighting is enabled and at least one light is on
<li> Textures are disabled
<li> The ModelView matrix stack contains only the camera translation and
orientation, and the Projection matrix a perspective projection matrix.
</ul>

The latter is likely to be the problem. gleem expects to be able to
render its manipulators in world coordinates, and the camera
parameters you give the library must correspond to the current state
of the ModelView and Projection matrices. See
<code>TestExaminerViewer.java</code> or
<code>TestExaminerViewer.cpp</code> for an example of how an
application using gleem might be structured.

</p>

<hr width="50%">

<h2>
<a name = "PROBLEMS">
Known Problems
</a>
</h2>

<p>

The event handling code is inefficient in the case of multiple events per
render, which typically occurs when there are many manipulators in the
scene and rendering is slow. The mouse motion and passive motion event
handlers in <code>ManipManager</code> should be restructured to compress
the event input stream into salient events like "highlighted here" (after a
stream of passive motion events) and "dragged here" (after multiple mouse
drag events), the actual work being done in render(). This will probably
require tricky state management in <code>ManipManager</code>. Perhaps
render() should be renamed update() since it will be doing more work.
